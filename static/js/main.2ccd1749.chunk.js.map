 </p>\n      <div className=\"blog-content\">\n        <p>\n          At the moment you start using your laptop, multiple processes and\n          computations are performed in order to make this possible. Bits,\n          registers, and logic gates are the most common types of hardware used\n          in a typical computer to do these tasks. Quantum computers, on the\n          other hand, work with a distinct type of technology. Qubits, quantum\n          registers and logic gates are the building blocks of these quantum\n          computers. While most of the names sound similar there working is\n          worlds apart.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          We're not attempting to construct a Quantum \"Computer,\" but rather a\n          Quantum \"Processor\" that can be controlled using a regular interface\n          similar to that found on our laptops. These Quantum Processors are\n          made up of qubits.The hardware system must fulfil a number of\n          requirements.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The first property which must be fulfilled is the ability to hold the\n          initial state. We must be able to put our system into a starting point\n          from where it will be able to follow different properties of quantum\n          computing. Superposition or entanglement of two quantum states, for\n          example.This beginning point is usually the ground state, where the\n          system's energy is at its lowest.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The second property is performing a universal family of unitary\n          transformations on one or more qubits.This is how quantum gates are\n          applied to qubits, which are crucial for the implementation of these\n          systems. Larger algorithms are decomposed into gates, which are then\n          implemented one at a time.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The third property is that the system must be able to withstand\n          measurement. This is akin to the famous Schrodinger's cat, where the\n          cat is either dead or alive when you open the box. Similarly, when we\n          measure the quantum state, it collapses into one of two possible\n          states. If a system possesses the three features listed above, it can\n          function as a quantum processor. Let's have a look at some of the\n          systems that are currently being investigated as potential quantum\n          processors.\n        </p>\n        <h3 className=\"blog-heading\">Spin Qubits</h3>\n        <p>\n          Using electron spin as Qubits will appear intuitive to people who have\n          attended a Quantum Mechanics course. Because electrons have all of the\n          traits listed above, their spin can only be in one of two states: up\n          or down.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          These electrons can be isolated using Quantum Dots, which are\n          extremely small semiconducting materials that allow electrons to\n          behave independently of other subatomic particles in their\n          environment. Alternating Magnetic Fields may be used to control the\n          quantum state of the electrons in these nanoparticles, and measurement\n          can be done using a magnetic field perpendicular to the one used to\n          manipulate the state of our system.Multi Qubit gates can be\n          implemented by decreasing the potential barrier between any two\n          qubits.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Spin Qubits can operate at temperatures of 1-4K, which is a\n          significant advantage over other systems. However, because to the\n          presence of additional electrons and nuclei (essentially any subatomic\n          particle) in the Quantum Dot, they confront a greater problem:\n          excessive noise.\n        </p>\n        <Image\n          imgName={spin_qubit}\n          imgCaption=\"Intel has been developing spin qubit systems\"\n          imgSource=\"https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsroom.intel.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F11%2F2020%2F04%2FSpin-Qubit-Intel-1.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsroom.intel.com%2Fnews%2Fintel-qutech-demonstrate-high-fidelity-hot-qubits-practical-quantum-systems%2F&tbnid=tLBx8tmPCBkV1M&vet=12ahUKEwivh6ubn5_xAhXEQX0KHXq1BpQQMygBegUIARCgAQ..i&docid=JgM1ZXjwmYPzFM&w=7360&h=4912&q=spin%20qubits%20quantum%20dots&hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwivh6ubn5_xAhXEQX0KHXq1BpQQMygBegUIARCgAQ\"\n        />\n        <h3 className=\"blog-heading\">Ion Trapped Qubits</h3>\n        <p>\n          Instead of using the spin states as the basis for computation, Ion\n          trapped qubits use Ions which are trapped in space using\n          electromagnetic fields. The Ion trap used by quantum computers was\n          designed in the 1950s by Wolfgang Paul, one of the leading pioneers of\n          Quantum Mechanics. He used an oscillating electric field at radio\n          frequency to create potential in the form of a saddle; the ions are\n          trapped in the centre of the saddle point.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          These qubits can be created in one of two ways: using two ground state\n          hyperfine levels or using one ground state and one excited state. The\n          first is referred to as a hyperfine qubit, while the second is\n          referred to as optical qubits.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The first requirement is initialization of the quantum state is done\n          by using optical pumping. The excited ion is generated by a laser, and\n          subsequently decays to a state that is not in resonance with the\n          laser, which can be utilized as your ground state. This ground state\n          can be further manipulated into other states by changing the\n          electromagnetic field which has been applied for creating the trap .\n          The final procedure we want is measurement, this is also performed\n          using a laser which is only coupled to one of the states, causing a\n          photon to be created when the qubit collapses in this state, which is\n          then detected.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Ion trapped qubits have shown promising results and IonQ has been able\n          to build a 32 qubit record breaking quantum computer using trapped ion\n          qubits.\n        </p>\n        <Image\n          imgName={ion_qubit}\n          imgCaption=\"IonQ 32-qubit trapped ion qubit chip\"\n          imgSource=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2020/10/07/ionq-releases-a-new-32-qubit-trapped-ion-quantum-computer-with-massive-quantum-volume-claims/\"\n        />\n        <h3 className=\"blog-heding\">Superconducting qubits</h3>\n        <p>\n          Both spin and ion trapped qubits have exploited naturally occurring\n          atoms in their construction. On the other hand, superconducting qubits\n          are entirely man-made. This offers us an advantage because we can\n          control all of our system's parameters.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The Transmon qubit is basically an LC oscillator with a non-linear\n          inductor, a Superconducting Josephson Junction, in place of the linear\n          inductor. While a linear LC oscillator acts like a harmonic quantum\n          system with equispaced energy levels, a non-linear one acts like an\n          anharmonic oscillator. We leverage this anharmonicity and use this to\n          isolate the ground and the first excited state.\n        </p>\n        <Image\n          imgName={transmon_qubit}\n          imgCaption=\"4 qubit device using Transmon Qubit by IBM\"\n          imgSource=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmon\"\n        />\n        <p>\n          The state of our qubit system can be controlled by a drive line via\n          capacitive coupling.

However, hundreds of millions of animals are still\n          employed in laboratories every year for drug testing, medical\n          training, biological investigations, and even aesthetic testing. For\n          the sake of experimentation, thousands of innocent animals have been\n          killed in these studies.

There exist plenty of\n          databases containing information about properties of different\n          molecules, which can be used for this purpose.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          This implies that no physical living subjects are required for the\n          experiment. This may appear to be relatively simple, it is not\n          possible to accomplish on ordinary computers. Even super and cluster\n          computers can't recreate the chemical events that occur inside the\n          human body.\n        </p>\n        <p>So is there a way to solve this problem?</p>\n        <p>\n          Well, Quantum Computers have shown an exponential speed over classical\n          computers. According to research, using these devices, it is feasible\n          to replicate chemical reactions with a high degree of precision. The\n          results of these computations will be used to determine which\n          compounds are potentially detrimental or useful to our bodies.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          This saves a lot of resources - time, money, and the misery that these\n          poor living beings must endure.\n        </p>\n        <h3 className=\"blog-heading\">What are we trying to simulate?</h3>\n        <p>\n          Chemical equations, as we all know, are made up of molecules, each of\n          which has its own set of characteristics.

These molecules can then be further analyzed as we\n          will see later.\n        </p>\n        <p>What would be the governing principle for this software?</p>\n        <p>\n          Quantum mechanical equations, such as the Many-Body Schrodinger\n          Equation, will be solved at the atomic level, taking into\n          consideration all of the molecules. The numeric values obtained from\n          these computations will be compared with those in the database to see\n          which molecules are produced as time passes.

The\n          Hamiltonian(H), the Wave Function, and the Energy of each State, all\n          of which evolve over time, make up the Schrodinger equation. The main\n          element that defines our system is the Hamiltonian.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Our main goal is to find the Hamiltonian's eigen equations and\n          eigenvalues. These are, respectively, the Wavefunction and the Energy.\n          This is simple for a few atoms, but as the number of atoms grows, the\n          number of terms inside the Hamiltonian grows exponentially, creating a\n          gigantic mess that is unsolvable by conventional computers.\n        </p>\n        <p>Here quantum computers come to the rescue !</p>\n        <h3 className=\"blog-heading\">\n          Why are quantum computers better at simulating chemical equations than\n          classical computers?\n        </h3>\n        <p>\n          Perhaps because chemical equations can be predicted using Quantum\n          Mechanical laws, and Quantum Computers have the word \"Quantum\" in\n          their name.

These properties can be used by certain\n          algorithms for modelling molecules.

Quantum circuits can be used to represent these states. In\n          VQE, we make a guess at a circuit that will be able to determine a\n          molecule's quantum state; this circuit is called ansatz. The ansatz\n          circuit is constructed using some fixed components and a few variable\n          parameters. With each iteration, the parameters are tweaked in order\n          to discover the lowest possible energy for our Quantum State (the most\n          stable), which will reveal a lot about the molecule.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          VQE is a fantastic Algorithm that has been used to model real-world\n          molecules like LiH. Researchers were able to find the interatomic\n          distance between lithium and hydrogen. It can run on Noisy Quantum\n          Computers because it incorporates the best aspects of both classical\n          and quantum computing. The ansatz or our guess quantum circuit is the\n          quantum part, the classical part is where we optimize the parameters\n          of our ansatz in order to get the ground state energy.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Despite the fact that we are still a long way from replicating\n          chemical reactions inside human beings, VQE serves as confirmation\n          that we are on the correct road and that quantum computers can really\n          simulate Molecules.\n        </p>\n        <Image\n          imgName={interatomicDistance}\n          imgCaption=\"Simulating the interatomic distance between the LiH molecule using VQE\"\n          imgSource=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.05018.pdf\"\n        />\n        <p>\n          For a more depth intro to VQE look at this{' '}\n          <a\n            href=\"For a more depth intro to VQE look at this research paper\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            rel=\"noreferrer\"\n          >\n            research paper\n          </a>\n        </p>\n        <h3 className=\"blog-heading\">Simualtions over Animal testing</h3>\n        <p>\n          One important consideration is that animal testing is fraught with\n          controversy.
